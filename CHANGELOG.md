- `changelogen generate` - Generate changelog block
- `changelogen release` - Full release pipeline
- `changelogen github` - Sync release to GitHub

**Quality:**
- Comprehensive test suite with 25+ integration tests
- Snapshot testing for output validation
- Determinism tests for reproducible results
